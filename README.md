# Flock App
Flock is an event app that makes planning easy! 

Find your friends and assign them tasks for any kind of get together

## Overview

The purpose of this app is to lessen the burden of trying to organize trips and outings with friends. Sometimes it can be nerve racking trying to make sure events go as planned and that everyone in the group is well informed. No matter how big or small the event may be, our app will allow users the opportunity to build an event that is well detailed and accessible.

## Features
* The user will be able to create an account and post events.

* The user can post two types of events:
  * Stationary events
  * On the fly events

* Stationary events:
  * Require a general location, a description, event time, tracking time frame, attendees, and tasks
  * Provide attendees the opportunity to assign themselves a task and view a map of the events radius and other attendees locations.

* On the fly events:
  * Require a general location, event time, tracking time frame, and attendees
  * Designate a group leader and the radius will be based on their location or the location of the main cluster.

* The user will be notified when an event's tracking period will begin and will be able to opt out of this feature.
