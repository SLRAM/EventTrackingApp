# Flock App

## App Overview
The user will be able to create an account and post events. The user can post two types of events. Stationary event posts require a general location, a description, event time, tracking time frame, attendees, and tasks. Movement based event posts require a general location, event time, tracking time frame, and attendees. Stationary events will provide attendees the opportunity to assign themselves a task and view a map of the events radius and other attendees locations. Movement based events will designate a group leader and the radius will be based on their location or the location of the main cluster. The user will be notified when an event's tracking period will begin and will be able to opt out of this feature.

The purpose of this app is to lessen the burden of trying to organize trips and outings with friends. Sometimes it can be nerve racking trying to make sure events go as planned and that everyone in the group is well informed. No matter how big or small the event may be, our app will allow users the opportunity to build an event that is well detailed and accessible.
